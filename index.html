            <h4 class="text-bolder">Reiki</h4>
            <p>Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is administered by "laying on hands" and is based on the idea that an unseen "life force energy" flows through us and is what causes us to
              be alive. If one's "life force energy" is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress, and if it is high, we are more capable of being healthy.</p>

              <p>The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words - Rei which means "God's Wisdom or the Higher Power" and Ki which is "life force energy". So Reiki is actually "spiritually guided life force energy."</p>

              <p>A treatment feels like a wonderful glowing radiance that flows through and around you. Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects that include relaxation and feelings of
              peace, security and wellbeing. Many have reported miraculous results.</p>

              <p>Reiki is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that everyone can use. It has been effective in helping virtually every known illness and malady and always creates a beneficial effect. It also works
              in conjunction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery.</p>

              <p>Its use is not dependent on one's intellectual capacity or spiritual development and therefore is available to everyone.</p>

              <p>While Reiki is spiritual in nature, it is not a religion. It has no dogma, and there is nothing you must believe in order to learn and use Reiki. In fact, Reiki is not dependent on belief at all and will work whether you believe in it
              or not.</p>

            <h4 class="text-bolder">Gua Sha</h4>
            <p>Gua sha (Chinese: 刮痧; pinyin: guā shā), meaning "scraping sha-bruises", is a traditional Chinese medical treatment in which the skin is scraped to produce light bruising. Practitioners believe gua sha releases unhealthy elements from injured areas and stimulates blood flow and healing. Gua sha is sometimes referred to as "spooning" or "coining" by English speakers, it has also been given the descriptive French name, tribo-effleurage.</p>

            <p>The term translates roughly "to scrape wind", as in Vietnamese culture "catching a cold" or fever is often referred to as trúng gió, "to catch wind". The origin of this term is the Shang Han Lun, a ~220 CE Chinese Medical text on cold induced disease

            <h4 class="text-bolder">Cupping</h4>
            <p>Cupping has been found in Egyptian pictorial records from around 1500BC with the practice then recorded as being taken up by the Greeks and on to the modern practice that is carried out today. However, despite its history, cupping an unutilised form of therapy when compared to massage and acupuncture but has similar roots and methods of healing.</p>

            <p>Traditional massage squashes tissues and muscles to force toxins and dead cells into the blood stream (to be removed by the liver and renal system), cupping is seen as a "reverse massage’, separating and lifting the tissues to pull toxins and dead cells up into the subcutaneous layers (skin), these are then removed by the lymph system.</p>

            <p>Cups can be used over acupressure points to release muscles or across whole meridian systems to stimulate the body’s energy flow and the combination of massage and cupping is used to have a very strong healing effect on the body.</p>

            <p>Please see these links to Science Direct and The National Center for Biotechnology Information for information on studies carried out on Cupping: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095754814000040" target="_blank">Science Direct</a>            | <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3224248/" target="_blank">NCBI</a>.</p>
